  "meta_description": "Concise description with key value prop and primary use case (150-160 chars)",
  "headings": [
    {"tag": "h1", "text": "Primary heading with product name"},
    {"tag": "h2", "text": "Section heading"},
    {"tag": "h2", "text": "Section heading"}
  ],
  "product_jsonld": {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "From fact sheet",
    "description": "From fact sheet",
    "category": "From fact sheet",
    "additionalProperty": [
      {
        "@type": "PropertyValue",
        "name": "spec name",
        "value": "spec value",
        "unitText": "unit"
      }
    ]
  }
}

## Guidelines
- title_tag: Include product name + category. Keep under 60 characters.
- meta_description: Summarize the product's key value. Keep 150-160 characters.
- headings: Provide 1 H1 and 4-8 H2s. H2s should map to: Overview, Key Features, Specifications, Use Cases, How It Works, Integration, Compliance, FAQ.
- product_jsonld: Valid schema.org Product markup. Only include fields present in the fact sheet.
  - Include certifications only if in fact sheet certifications_standards.
  - Include additionalProperty for each key_spec that has evidence.
  - Do NOT include offers/pricing unless in the fact sheet.

## Hard rules
- All text must be grounded in the fact sheet.
- Do NOT invent product names, categories, specs, or certifications.
- Do NOT include pricing, offers, or availability unless in the source.
- Do NOT name competitors.

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences.
