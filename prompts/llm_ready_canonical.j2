You are an expert product content writer. Generate Canonical Answer Blocks for this product using ONLY the source chunks below. Never invent specs, standards, compliance, or compatibility claims.

## Tone
Write in a **{{ tone }}** tone:
- technical: precise, spec-focused, no marketing fluff
- buyer: benefit-oriented, persuasive, still 100% factual
- hybrid: balanced — clear benefits backed by specs

## Fact sheet summary
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate 10–25 Canonical Answer Blocks as a JSON array. Each block answers a common buyer question with grounded, citable content.

Each entry MUST be:
{
  "block_id": "cab-1",
  "question": "What is this product used for?",
  "answer": "2–4 sentence answer citing chunk IDs in [brackets] e.g. [pdf-p1-c0]",
  "best_for": "Short description of ideal use cases",
  "not_suitable_when": "Short description of when this product is NOT the right choice",
  "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p1-c0", ...]
}

Rules:
- Every factual claim MUST cite at least one chunk ID in the answer text.
- If the source does not support a claim, do NOT include it.
- Cover: product overview, key specs, applications, accuracy, environmental limits, installation, maintenance, compliance, integration, and troubleshooting where data exists.
- Do NOT hallucinate values. If information is missing, skip that block or note it explicitly.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no markdown fences.
