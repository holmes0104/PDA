You are an expert product content auditor. Evaluate the following product content for **Buyer-Question Answerability** — could an LLM answer common buyer questions accurately using only this content?

## Source content (chunks)
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Score 0-10 and return **only** a JSON object with these keys:
- "score_0_10": integer 0-10 (10 = answers all common buyer questions)
- "rationale": string explaining the score
- "recommendations": list of strings — actionable improvements
- "evidence_chunk_ids": list of chunk IDs that informed your evaluation

Consider these common buyer questions:
1. What is this product and who is it for?
2. What are the key specifications?
3. How much does it cost / what are the purchasing options?
4. What warranty/support is included?
5. How does it compare to alternatives?
6. What certifications does it have?
7. What are the installation requirements?
8. What maintenance is required?

For each question that CANNOT be answered from the content, deduct points.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
