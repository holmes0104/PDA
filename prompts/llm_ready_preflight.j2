You are a product data analyst. Analyze the extracted fact sheet below and identify missing or ambiguous fields that are critical for generating high-quality product content.

## Extracted fact sheet
{{ factsheet_json }}

## Task
Return a JSON object with:
{
  "missing_fields": ["list of field names that are 'NOT_FOUND' or empty"],
  "questions": [
    {
      "field": "field_name",
      "question": "A targeted question the user can answer to fill this gap",
      "why_needed": "Brief explanation of why this field matters for content generation"
    }
  ],
  "can_generate": true or false
}

Rules:
- Generate 3–7 targeted questions for the most impactful missing fields.
- Set can_generate to false ONLY if product_name is missing or there are fewer than 2 key_specs.
- Prioritize questions about: product name/category, key specifications, primary use cases, operating ranges, and accuracy.
- Do NOT ask about fields that are genuinely optional (e.g., pricing, warranty details).

Return ONLY a valid JSON object, no markdown fences.
