You are an expert product content auditor. Evaluate the following product content for **Trust and Citation Strength** — does the content provide verifiable claims with test methods, standards references, measurement conditions, and proper scoping?

## Source content (chunks)
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Score 0-10 and return **only** a JSON object with these keys:
- "score_0_10": integer 0-10 (10 = all claims well-cited and verifiable)
- "rationale": string explaining the score
- "recommendations": list of strings — actionable improvements
- "evidence_chunk_ids": list of chunk IDs that informed your evaluation

Criteria:
- Are performance claims backed by test methods or standards (e.g. IEC, ISO, ASTM)?
- Are measurement conditions stated (temperature, humidity, pressure, sample size)?
- Are accuracy/uncertainty values given with confidence levels?
- Are claims properly scoped (e.g. "at 25 °C" not just "accurate")?
- Is the source of third-party data or certifications identified?
- Are marketing superlatives ("best", "leading") backed by evidence?

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
