## Fact sheet
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate use-case pages as a JSON array. Each entry:

{
  "title": "Use Case Title",
  "slug": "use-case-title",
  "is_suggested": false,
  "problem_context": "Describe the problem/challenge this use case addresses [cite chunk IDs]",
  "solution_fit": "How this product solves the problem [cite chunk IDs]",
  "benefits": ["Benefit 1 [chunk ID]", "Benefit 2 [chunk ID]"],
  "implementation_notes": "Practical notes on deploying for this use case [cite chunk IDs]",
  "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p1-c0"]
}

## Hard rules
- Set is_suggested to false ONLY for use cases explicitly mentioned in the fact sheet primary_use_cases.
- Set is_suggested to true for use cases you infer or suggest; prefix title with "[Suggested] ".
- Ground every factual claim with chunk ID citations.
- Do NOT invent specs or certifications.
- If suggesting a use case, make sure it is plausible given the product specs and category.
- Do NOT name competitors unless their name appears in the source.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown fences.
