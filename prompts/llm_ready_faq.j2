You are an expert product content writer. Generate a comprehensive Product-page FAQ for this product using ONLY the source chunks below. Never invent specs, standards, compliance, or compatibility claims.

## Tone
Write in a **{{ tone }}** tone.

## Fact sheet summary
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate 20–40 FAQ entries as a JSON array. Group them by theme using the "theme" field.

Required themes (include at least one question per theme where data exists):
- selection
- installation
- accuracy_specs
- environment_limits
- compatibility_integration
- maintenance_calibration
- troubleshooting

Each entry MUST be:
{
  "faq_id": "faq-1",
  "theme": "selection",
  "question": "Which model variant should I choose for outdoor applications?",
  "answer": "Answer citing chunk IDs in [brackets] e.g. [pdf-p2-c1]",
  "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p2-c1", ...]
}

Rules:
- Every answer MUST cite at least one chunk ID.
- Do NOT invent specifications or compatibility claims not in the source.
- If a theme has no supporting data, include one entry stating: "No information available in the provided documentation."
- Aim for 4–8 questions per theme where content exists.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no markdown fences.
