You are an expert product content writer. Generate Selection Guidance for this product using ONLY the source chunks below. Never invent specs, standards, compliance, or compatibility claims.

## Tone
Write in a **{{ tone }}** tone.

## Fact sheet summary
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate selection guidance as a single JSON object with these fields:

{
  "decision_criteria": [
    {
      "criterion_id": "dc-1",
      "statement": "Choose this product if you need [specific requirement] because [grounded reason] [pdf-p1-c0]",
      "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p1-c0"]
    }
  ],
  "comparison_table": [
    {
      "variant": "Model A",
      "attributes": {
        "measurement_range": "...",
        "accuracy": "...",
        "output": "...",
        "environment": "..."
      },
      "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p3-c2"]
    }
  ],
  "decision_tree_md": "Markdown-formatted decision tree (use nested bullet list with -> arrows)",
  "missing_info": ["List any comparison attributes that are NOT available in the source"],
  "cited_chunk_ids": ["all chunk IDs used across this section"]
}

Rules:
- Generate 3–8 decision criteria as "Choose this product if…" statements.
- If multiple model variants exist in the source, generate a comparison table with one row per variant.
- If the source does NOT contain enough info to compare variants, leave comparison_table empty and add items to missing_info.
- NEVER fabricate model names, specs, or compatibility.
- Every statement must cite at least one chunk ID.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object, no markdown fences.
