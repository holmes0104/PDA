## Fact sheet
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate a FAQ as a JSON array. Each entry:

{
  "question": "Clear buyer question",
  "answer": "Grounded answer citing chunk IDs in [brackets]",
  "is_factual": true,
  "cited_chunk_ids": ["pdf-p1-c0"]
}

Cover these themes (where source data exists):
1. Product overview and positioning
2. Key specifications and performance
3. Use cases and applications
4. Installation and integration
5. Maintenance and calibration
6. Compliance and certifications
7. Constraints and limitations
8. Troubleshooting
9. Ordering and support (only if in source)

## Hard rules
- Every answer MUST cite at least one chunk ID for factual claims.
- Set is_factual to false for editorial/suggested answers not directly from source. Prefix answer with "[Suggested] ".
- Do NOT invent specs, certifications, or pricing.
- If a question cannot be answered from the source, either skip it or answer with "Information not available in current documentation." and set is_factual to false.
- Do NOT name competitors unless their name appears in the source.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown fences.
