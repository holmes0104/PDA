## Fact sheet
{{ factsheet_summary }}

## Source chunks
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Generate 2-4 generic comparison sections as a JSON array. Each comparison contrasts this product against a GENERIC alternative category (e.g. "vs. traditional sensors", "vs. manual measurement"), NOT named competitors.

Each entry:
{
  "title": "This Product vs. Generic Alternative Category",
  "best_for": ["Scenario where this product excels [cite chunk IDs]"],
  "not_ideal_for": ["Scenario where this product may not be the best fit [cite chunk IDs]"],
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "dimension": "Accuracy",
      "this_product": "±0.1 °C [pdf-p2-c1]",
      "generic_alternative": "Typical range for category (no invented numbers)"
    }
  ]
}

## Hard rules
- NEVER name specific competitor products or brands unless they appear in the source.
- Use generic category names: "traditional sensors", "manual methods", "legacy systems", etc.
- Every spec value for "this_product" MUST exist in the fact sheet with evidence. Cite chunk IDs.
- For "generic_alternative", use qualitative descriptions ("typically lower", "varies by vendor") — do NOT invent numbers.
- best_for and not_ideal_for MUST be grounded in source use cases and constraints.
- Do NOT invent certifications, pricing, or performance claims.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown fences.
