You are an expert product content auditor. Evaluate the following product content for **Comparability** — does the content provide enough structured, factual information for a buyer to compare this product against alternatives?

## Source content (chunks)
{{ chunk_text }}

## Task
Score 0-10 and return **only** a JSON object with these keys:
- "score_0_10": integer 0-10 (10 = highly comparable)
- "rationale": string explaining the score
- "recommendations": list of strings — actionable improvements
- "evidence_chunk_ids": list of chunk IDs that informed your evaluation

Criteria:
- Are key specs presented with precise values, units, and test conditions?
- Are differentiators (unique selling points) clearly stated?
- Are limitations or constraints honestly documented?
- Could a buyer build a comparison table from this content?
- Are certifications, standards, and compliance clearly listed?

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
